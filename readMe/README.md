--Connect Four--

Connect four is a classic house hold board game where players alternate dropping their color of tile into the board in an attmept to line up four in a row. It is up to the opponent to block the other player from connecting four, while simultaneously attempting to connect four of their own. 

Technologies used: In my virtual version of the game, I combined HTML, CSS, and Java Script to emulate the expirience of the physical version. 

Getting started: Player 1 (blue) always goes first and begins the game by clicking any circle on the board. Their chip will fall to the bottom row of the column they choose and player 2 (green) will then get to go. Turns will alternate until a winner is declared or until the board is full. At any point in the game, the 'rematch' button can be clicked to reset the board to empty. 

Next steps: In the future I would like to look into how the game displays on different screens such as phones and large monitors. I also think the game could benefit from the addition of optional sound effects.
